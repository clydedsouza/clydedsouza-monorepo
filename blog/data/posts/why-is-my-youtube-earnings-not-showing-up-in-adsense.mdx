### Why Is My YouTube Earnings Not Showing Up in AdSense?

### The problem

Let’s say you’ve been consistently uploading content to your YouTube channel and the efforts have finally paid off — you’re now eligible for monetisation — congratulations!

A few days later, you head over to YouTube Studio and check the **Revenue** tab, and in the **How much you’re earning** section, you see a dollar amount come through. This is exciting!

You then head over to the **Earn** page, where in the **Getting paid** section, you would’ve done some initial set-up to configure your Google AdSense account required for YouTube to be able to pay you.

Strangely enough, even if you’ve set up your AdSense account but haven’t been paid yet, you’ll still see a message saying **Setup in progress**.

You then head over to the Google AdSense account to see if the same dollar amount is reflected there as well. But after clicking on the **Payments info** page, it doesn’t show the same amount coming through.

### Troubleshooting

The first thing to troubleshoot is to confirm you have the correct AdSense account linked. You can check the ID, which should be prefixed with `pub-` followed by some numbers, like the screenshot below.

And then when you log in to the Google AdSense account, and visit the **Account information** page, you should see the same publisher ID. If it’s the same, then you’ve linked the correct account.

Even though the correct AdSense account is connected, why do you then see the revenue amount on YouTube but not in Google AdSense?

### Solution

Based on [this article](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14728151), the earnings from YouTube come through to the AdSense account between the 7th and 12th of each month. If you’re checking Google AdSense before these dates, then you may not see the revenue amount come through the AdSense portal. Only once the amount comes through to AdSense, you’ll be able to configure your bank account and fill up the tax forms.

Once you’ve entered your bank details, AdSense will transfer an amount to your bank account, which should be less than a dollar, and then you’ll need to come back to the AdSense portal to complete verification, which is essentially entering what amount you’ve received.

With that, you should be good to go! Payments should come through every month if you’ve met the payment threshold.

That’s it! Thanks for reading.
