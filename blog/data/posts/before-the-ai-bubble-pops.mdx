### Introduction

After major AI companies made clever circular deals to finance each other, thereby benefiting the valuation of their companies, both the IMF and the Bank of England [have raised alarm bells](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/09/imf-and-bank-of-england-join-growing-chorus-warning-of-an-ai-bubble.html) about soaring stock market valuations and a potential for the AI bubble to burst soon.

Various news outlets and people around the world have joined the chorus and are comparing it with the dot-com bubble. Much like the dot-com bubble, where companies overspent on infrastructure with negligible returns, today's big giants are [spending billions](https://fortune.com/2025/09/28/ai-dot-com-bubble-parallels-history-explained-companies-revenue-infrastructure/) on chip manufacturing, data centres, and AI talent, but not much is seen in revenue or AI progress. This, combined with the debt they're taking on for the capital expenditure, and the hype-based stock price valuation, is driving the AI bubble larger by the day.

The eerie similarities in the scenarios make you wonder, history might not repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme, doesn't it?

### Crystal ball

Now, unless you're a time traveller or have a crystal ball, it's impossible to predict if and when the bubble will pop. However, if it does, then [experts are expecting](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-ai-bubble-is-17-times-the-size-of-the-dot-com-frenzy-this-analyst-argues-046e7c5c) the consequences to be dire, and potentially, seventeen times that of the dot-com crash.

I should also probably make it clear that when I say AI bubble, I'm talking about it in a financial sense - the valuation bubble. It's when companies connected to AI are being priced far above their actual earnings or realistic growth potential, driven mostly by hype, speculation, and fear of missing out.

Disclaimer: Timing the market is not advised. This is an opinion piece, and none of this should be taken as financial advice.
If you're investing for the long term, or you reckon you wouldn't need to liquidate and withdraw those funds anytime soon, my opinion is that you don't need to worry too much.

For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the S&P 500 was at a high in October 2007 before it dipped to its lowest in March 2009. The market only recovered back in March 2013 to the levels it was in October 2007.

In a more recent example, the S&P 500 was at its high in December 2019 before hitting a low in March 2020 and then relatively quickly regaining the previous high in July 2020 itself.

Source: [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-chart)

It should be noted that in both examples above, not only did the S&P 500 recover to the previous high, but in the long run, it went way above and beyond that. For instance, since March 2009, the S&P 500 grew 816% (October 2025), and since March 2020, the S&P 500 grew 158% (October 2025). So, as long as you don't withdraw, you've not technically realised any of the losses, and eventually, that investment would've grown multi-fold. Eventually, time in the market beats timing the market.

However, if you're investing for the short term, or you think you might need those funds in the short term, then it's recommended to take a conservative approach and invest in something that's not subject to volatility.

Will the AI bubble actually pop? I don't know. Did I sell too early and possibly miss out on more gains? Probably. Do I regret it? Absolutely, not.

If the AI bubble pops, I've managed to take my profits and exit early. If it doesn't, I've managed to still take my profits and pivot to a conservative approach that I feel comfortable with, and something that works for my circumstances. Investing is never a one-size-fits-all approach. You just have to determine what's best for you.

### Investments

The S&P 500 is [heavily influenced](https://www.apolloacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ExtremeAIConcentration-090825.pdf) by AI companies, and a [large percentage of growth this year](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250814149/the-entire-stock-market-is-being-carried-by-these-four-ai-stocks) can be attributed to only less than a handful of companies, all courtesy of the AI hype. During the growth phase, as long as the AI companies are giving these massive returns, this can be beneficial, but when the opposite happens, it can result in a nosedive for your portfolio.

For my investments, I had been regularly investing in the [S&P 500 (Unhedged)](https://kernelwealth.co.nz/funds/sp-500-unhedged) using the dollar-cost averaging method. As pictured below, Kernel Wealth shows me where my money is invested, and unsurprisingly, the S&P 500 is entirely US-focused, and IT makes about 34% of the funds. Not only are the IT companies deeply involved with AI, but the non-IT sectors are also quite heavily influenced by AI.

The S&P 500 has generally been on a roll during the latter part of this year, and while the market is currently high, I've decided to sell my investments from the S&P 500. After all, the good adage of **sell high, buy low** is a great principle to follow.

I also had some investments in individual stocks like Nvidia, Intel, and some energy stocks and ETFs like OKLO and URA. I've sold them, too. Not just AI stocks, but also related stocks that blew up because of the AI hype.

After selling, I invested in Kernel's [Cash Plus](https://kernelwealth.co.nz/funds/kernel-cash-plus-fund) fund for a more conservative approach. While the fund returns aren't fixed, they'll still remain more or less stable compared to the stock market. It's also classified as a [PIE fund](https://intercom.help/kernelwealth/en/articles/5925324-what-is-a-pie-fund), which means that I may need to pay less tax.

I also invested in the [World ex-US fund](https://kernelwealth.co.nz/funds/world-ex-us), which invests in companies across 23 major economies excluding the US. Looking at the holdings and sectors where the funds are invested, this fund looks quite diversified and not too heavily invested in technology.

In terms of the distribution, I'd say I've roughly invested 60% into the Kernel's Cash Plus fund and 40% into the World ex-US fund.

### Retirement funds

Here in New Zealand, we have something called [KiwiSaver](https://www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver). This is meant to be a retirement fund, and one can only withdraw the funds under certain conditions, like buying your first home, facing financial hardships, moving abroad permanently, or retiring. This means that when the market is high, we can't just sell and withdraw it. Therefore, the next best thing is to move the funds.

I'm using Kernel Wealth for KiwiSaver, and I had originally invested in the [Global 100 funds](https://kernelwealth.co.nz/funds/global-100). As shown below, about 80% of the allocation is US-based, and about 46% of this fund allocation is in the IT sector. As you'd imagine, it did provide a great return, but it's also quite volatile.

I've adjusted my KiwiSaver portfolio and moved to [Conservative funds](https://kernelwealth.co.nz/funds/kernel-conservative-fund) with a diversified allocation of 30% shares and 70% cash and bonds. This enables my portfolio to be less volatile compared to the Global 100, but still get a little exposure to the share market. The downside is that it doesn't provide a significant return compared to the Global 100, but I suppose that's expected when one takes a conservative route.

### Term deposits

Where possible, I've renewed or created new term deposits with the institutions I'm currently banking with. BNZ is currently offering a term deposit rate of 3.65%pa for 180days, and for their special on-call account called [Rapid Save](https://www.bnz.co.nz/personal-banking/everyday-banking/rapid-save?km=rapidsave), they offer 2.30%pa. KiwiBank offers a [PIE term deposit](https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/investments/term-deposits/) rate of 3.70%pa, but since its PIE, it works out to an effective rate of 4.37%pa.

The current [rate of inflation in New Zealand](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/monetary-policy/about-monetary-policy/inflation) is 3%, and a 0.8% increase since last year. This means that the return on any investments made would need to beat the rate of inflation for you to actually earn a net income.

Term deposits don't provide a significant return when we consider the rate of inflation, but when we take a conservative approach, a stable growth is still better than nothing. And with the [depositor compensation scheme](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/dcs), up to &dollar;100,000 is covered in case these institutions fail.

### Emergency funds

Finally, it's a good idea to have a decent emergency fund. If you're new to this concept, having an emergency fund means setting aside a pre-decided amount in the bank for a rainy day. The recommendation is to have between 3–6 months' cash in the bank, depending on your living expenses.

If some sort of market crash were to happen, which has historically led to a [loss of jobs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp#:~:text=As%20a%20result,was%20June%202009), then the emergency funds are what would keep a person afloat during tough times.

Following this principle, I've increased my emergency fund coverage slightly and have spread it across more than one bank for contingency purposes.

### Buying the dip

With this strategy outlined above, it's quite easy to liquidate and withdraw cash as and when required without worrying too much about the losses/gains at that time. In case the market dips or crashes, I could easily redirect the term deposits or on-call savings to buy good value stocks, so once the market recovers, these value stocks will provide a decent return.

In conclusion, it's important to pick an investing strategy that works for your circumstances and offers you the required peace of mind.

That's it! Thanks for reading.
